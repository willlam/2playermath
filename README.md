# 2playermath

Create a 2-player guessing game where players take turns to answer simple addition problems. The math questions are automatically generated by the game. It should do this by picking two numbers between 1 and 20.

Both players start with 3 lives. They lose a life if they incorrectly answer a question. Scores will be displayed for every player and if a player gets a question wrong, the new score for that player will be shown.

The game doesnâ€™t end until one of the players loses all their lives.
